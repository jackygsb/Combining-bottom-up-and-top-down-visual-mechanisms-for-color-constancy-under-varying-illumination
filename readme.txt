This dataset contains three datasets for color constancy under varying illuminations, which are used in publication [1].

real-world dataset with multi-illuminant: the real-world dataset contains 37 images captured under vairous non-uniform 
light sources.

synthetic dataset with multi-illuminant: the dataset with the synthetic multiple illuminants contains 100 images.

MCC-BU+TD:  This dataset contains results of multiple MCC algorithms on several
real-world images taken from the web, which could be easily used and compared in any research publications.
