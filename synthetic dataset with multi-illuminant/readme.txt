This dataset with the synthetic multiple illuminants is used in article "Combining bottom-up and top-down visual
mechanisms for color constancy under varying illumination".  The image is re-rendered with at least four different light sources, which is suitable for 
initially evaluating the color constancy method based on multiple light sources.  If you use this dataset for the evaluation of your approach, please
cite our work as follows:
