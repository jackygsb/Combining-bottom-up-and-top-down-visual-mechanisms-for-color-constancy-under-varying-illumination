This dataset contains 35 real-world images with the various non-uniform color-bias, 
qualities, and resolutions manually taken from the web, which is very challenge for color constancy algorithms.
Our method is evaulated on the parts of images of this dataset. 
If you use this dataset for the evaluation of your approach and produce the results, please
cite our work as follows:

constancy under varying illumination,"
